          Coder and developer by passion.

          Tech and open source enthusiast.

          My name is Hector and I am an avid and strongly skilled individual in coding.
          I am currently delving deeper into full stack web development but am also comfortable in working in any other stack that is not web oriented.
          I am a strong believer in the fundamentals and am always adapting to the current standards and technologies as is necessary.
          I am a strong believer in open source, iteration and improvement/optimization.

          I am currently enrolled at the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin to quench my thirst for knowledge and to gain more insight into full stack web development.</p>
